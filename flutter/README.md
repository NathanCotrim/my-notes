### 🌋 What is?

<br>

Flutter basically is a multiplatform UI development kit that allows you create many kind of softwares, but it is focused in mobile apps.

### 📬 Where can I use Flutter?

<br>

Flutter has a great applicability!

- Mobile(Fuchsia, IOS, Android)
- Desktop(Win, Linux, Mac)
- WEB

Curiosity: Toyota is using Flutter as the main OS in its cars.

### 🥛 Can I access native resources from platforms with Flutter?

<br>

Yes, we can do that.

### 🛩️ How Flutter works under the hood?

<br>

Flutter uses a 100% customizable <i>Canvas</i> to render all elements/widgets and to receive events, like finger tappings.

The services like location and sensors(native resources), are accessed by the differents platforms "channels".

Flutter’s engine hosts the core technologies Skia – a 2D graphics rendering library – and the Dart language VM in a platform-specific shell. Any shell implements the respective platform APIs and handles the system’s application lifecycle events.

### 🦹‍♂️ The life without Flutter.

<br>

We have two approaches:

<b>Different code bases for each platform(for example, one for Android and another for IOS).</b>

Problems:

- One different team to each solution(more money).
- Is necessary a good communication between they to the resources stay look like in all platforms.

Benefits:

- Maintains a native performance.
- The resources are used in the best way.

<br>

<b>One code base</b>

In this approach, we need to use webviews to render graphic elements in different platforms with the same code, or a bridge in a common language, like is made in React Native(This bridge is a layer will interact with the native modules).

Problems:

- Bridges has many performance implications.

Benefits:

- One code base, less work and less team.

### ⏸️ So, “What’s new and exciting about Flutter?”

<br>

- The advantages of reactive views, with no JavaScript bridge

- Fast, smooth, and predictable; code compiles AOT to native (ARM) code

- The developer has full control over the widgets and layout

- Comes with beautiful, customizable widgets

- Great developer tools, with amazing hot reload

- More performant, more compatibility, more fun

### 💲 The Flutter language.

<br>

Dart is an open-source and object-oriented programming language with C-style syntax developed by Google in 2011.
The purpose of Dart programming is to create a frontend user interfaces for the web and mobile apps. It is under active development, compiled to native machine code for building mobile apps, inspired by other programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C#, and is Strongly Typed. Since Dart is a compiled language so you cannot execute your code directly; instead, the compiler parses it and transfer it into machine code.

### 🏪 Glossary

- Canvas: In computer science and visualization, a canvas is a container that holds various drawing elements (lines, shapes, text, frames containing others elements, etc.

<br>

- Native code: The native language/code is the language understood by the computer. For example, binary is the language understood by the computer. In programming, native code is code that is written to run on a specific processor.

<br>

- Web Viewer: The Web Viewer is a layout object that displays web content from a calculated URL. Limited interaction with web content is supported and it is not intended to replace all the functionality of a standard web browser.
